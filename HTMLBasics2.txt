**Introduction**
Let's continue learning more HTML. You've already covered a lot: how to set up <head> and <body> tags, how to make headings and paragraphs, and how to add images and links.

In this course, we'll take it to the next level:

a. Making ordered and unordered lists
b. Changing font size, color and type
c. Changing the background color
d. Aligning the text

**Unordered lists**
We just learned how to make ordered lists, but what if the order doesn't matter, what if we just want bullet points?

<h2>Taco Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Sour Cream</li>
</ul>
Does this look familiar?

First, we open our list with an unordered list <ul> tag
For each item we wish to add to the list, we use a list item tag <li> with text in between
We then tell the browser we are done with our list by calling our closing </ul> tag

**Font size**
Recall that <p> and </p> are opening and closing tags.

We can give tags more instructions by including attributes in the opening tag. An attribute is simply a characteristic or some description for the content in the element. You saw this with src in <img> and href in <a>.

Let's change the size of the text. How? We use the style attribute. We make it equal to font-size, followed by a colon, the size you want, and end it with px (short for "pixels"). For example:

<p style="font-size: 12px">

**Making comments
Make me into a comment.

<p>But leave me visible to the user!</p>

<!-- This is a comment! -->

Font size
Recall that <p> and </p> are opening and closing tags.

We can give tags more instructions by including attributes in the opening tag. An attribute is simply a characteristic or some description for the content in the element. You saw this with src in <img> and href in <a>.

Let's change the size of the text. How? We use the style attribute. We make it equal to font-size, followed by a colon, the size you want, and end it with px (short for "pixels"). For example:

<p style="font-size: 12px">

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>First font size change</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p style="font-size: 10px"> Some text for you to make tiny! </p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px"> Some text for you to make normal size!</p>
		<p style="font-size: 40px"> Some text for you to make super big!</p>
	</body>
</html>

**Font color**
What is awesome about the style attribute is that we use it a lot! And we can use it with many different tags, not just <p>. Let's now change the colors of our text in a heading.

To change the color of text, simply add the style attribute in the opening tag, then make the style equal to "color:blue" (or whatever color you like). For example:

<h2 style="color:red">
What if you want to change the color and the size of the text? Simple! Just add a semi-colon between each bit. For example:

<h2 style="color: green; font-size:12px">
A full list of available colors can be found here.

Note: do not type something like:

<h2 <h2 style="color: green; font-size:12px">
If you incorrectly nest your HTML tags like that, your code will not pass.

**Font family**
We've covered font colors and font sizes. But we want more power! We want to decide what font type to use. We can do this using font-family, like this:

<h1 style="font-family: Arial">Title</h1>
First we wrote <h1>Big title</h1>
Then inside the opening <h1> tag, we added a style attribute, and set it equal to "font-family: Arial".
This styles the <h1> tag with Arial font.

We can do the same for other tags. So we could have a li:

<li style="font-family: Arial">Hello!</li>
Here's a list of available fonts.


Aligning the text
Often it is nice to be able to move the text around. To do so, we again use the style attribute. And then we use "text-align:left" (or right, or center) to determine the location of the text.

<h1 style="text-align:center">

Strong words!
We can change the appearance of words. What if we want to make them bold?

Surprise! We don't have to use the style attribute. Here are the steps:

Identify the word or words you want to bold.
Surround those words with opening tag <strong> and closing tag </strong>.
Celebrate how awesome you are at HTML!

Emphasize words!
Aside from bolding words, we often want to italicize words for emphasis. (Hint, hint.)

Like bolding, we do not need to use the style attribute. Instead:

Identify the word or words you want to italicize.
Surround the word or words with the opening tag <em> and closing tag </em>.
Be humble and grateful for your newfound powers.
