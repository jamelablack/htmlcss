HTML and CSS
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext means "text with links in it." Any time you click on a word that brings you to a new webpage, you've clicked on hypertext!

A markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more. HTML is the markup language we'll be learning.

What makes webpages pretty? That's CSSâ€”Cascading Style Sheets. Think of it like skin and makeup that covers the bones of HTML. We'll learn HTML first, then worry about CSS in later courses.

The first thing we should do is set up the skeleton of the page.

a. Always put <!DOCTYPE html> on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading (in this case, HTML).
b. Always put <html> on the next line. This starts the HTML document.
c. Always put </html> on the last line. This ends the HTML document.

Basic terminology
To learn more HTML, we should learn how to talk about HTML. Already you have seen we use <>s a lot.

Things inside <>s are called tags.
Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
Example of opening tag: <html>
Example of closing tag: </html>
You can think of tags as being like parentheses: whenever you open one, you should close it. Tags also nest, so you should close them in the right order: the most recently opened tag should be the first one closed, like in the example below.

<first tag><second tag>Some text!</second tag></first tag>
The last exercise taught us how to set up our HTML file. Everything we do now will go between <html> and </html>.

Typical setup:
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head> 
	<title>  My Webpage </title>
	</head>
	<body>
	    <p>Hello world!</p>
	    <p> My name is Jamela</p>
	</body>
	
</html>


More about headings!
HTML actually lets us have more than one heading size. There are six heading sizes, where <h1> is the boss and <h6> is puny!

			<h1> - The CEO
			<h2> - VP
			<h3> - Director
			<h4> - Middle management
			<h5> - Lowly assistant
			<h6> - Gets coffee for everyone

Links
What if you wanted to send the user to another part of your website, or another website altogether? You use hyperlinks, or links for short!

<a href="http://www.codecademy.com">My Favorite Site!</a>
First, there's an opening <a> tag and that tag has an attribute called href. The href value tells your link where you want it to go, in this case http://www.codecademy.com.
Then you have a description of your link between your opening <a> and your closing </a> tags. This is what you will be able to click on.
Finally, you have your closing </a> tag.

Adding images
You can add images to your websites to make them look fancy.

We use an image tag, like so: <img>. This tag is a bit different from the others. Instead of putting the content between the tags, you tell the tag where to get the picture using src. It's also different because there is no ending tag. It has / in the tag to close it: <img src="url" />.

Click that image
Good work! Now you know how to add links and images to your website. Why not make that image a link? For example:

<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">
    <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/f3a16fb6.jpg"/>
</a>
First we open our <a> tag and point the href to http://www.codecademy.com/ again.
But this time, instead of using text inside the <a> tag, we use an <img> tag.
Finally, we have our closing </a> tag.
Now when you click on the yellow duck, you will be taken to http://www.codecademy.com!

Placing one HTML tag inside of another is called nesting.
